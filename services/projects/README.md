# Projects

Reverse proxy for accessing my web projects. To access a project, enter the
url:

```
https://projects.jeremyasuncion.io/{project}
```

You can find the source code for each project in
[demos/](https://github.com/codemonkey800/jeremyasuncion.io/tree/master/projects). Each project will either
be its own project root directory or a git submodule.

To access a home page showing all of the projects available, enter the url:
https://projects.jeremyasuncion.io.
